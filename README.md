Mosquitoes Breeding Grounds Detector ü¶üüîç
Description ‚ÑπÔ∏è
The detection project with the MBG dataset is an ongoing effort by various computer vision and signal processing researchers from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, with contributions from CEFET. It is currently funded by CAPES through master's and doctoral scholarships.

This project involves detecting mosquito breeding sites and aims to contribute to the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue fever, Zika virus, and Chikungunya. Mosquito-borne diseases represent a significant threat to public health, especially in peripheral areas where sanitation and access to health services may be limited. Dengue fever, in particular, is a major concern in these regions due to its potential for outbreaks and serious health complications.

Detecting breeding sites is crucial for controlling mosquito populations and preventing disease transmission. However, manual inspection of potential breeding sites is time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially in large urban areas. Therefore, the use of artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies can greatly facilitate the work of health agents in identifying and monitoring these breeding sites.

Project Status üöß
Please note that this project is still in development, and there is currently no framework for detecting all objects. The main focus of this repository is on tire detection, which is a common mosquito breeding site.

Dataset üìÇ
The project features a database called MBG, which contains 13 videos filmed by a DJI Phantom Vision 4 PRO UAV drone in Rio de Janeiro üöÅ. It is important to note that some videos were filmed in real urban areas, while others were produced by students in low grasslands and by placing tires in random locations reachable by the drone.
